## ![BERT](https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/methods/new_BERT_Overall.jpg)


## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. BERT is a powerful pre-trained language model that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.x recommended)
- PyTorch and Transformers library
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
We use the SMILE Twitter Emotion dataset for sentiment analysis. This dataset contains labeled tweets categorized into different emotions.

## Setup and Execution
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-bert.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install torch pandas scikit-learn transformers
```

3. Download the SMILE dataset and place it in the project directory.

4. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform sentiment analysis using BERT.

## Steps and Code Explanation
- **Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Loading and preprocessing the dataset, converting labels into numeric values, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

- **Loading Tokenizer and Encoding Data:** Using the BERT tokenizer to preprocess and encode the text data. Tokenized text is converted into input IDs and attention masks.

- **Setting up BERT Pretrained Model:** Creating a BERT model for sequence classification, specifying the number of labels, and disabling certain output components.

- **Creating Data Loaders:** Setting up data loaders for training and validation datasets to efficiently load batches of data.

- **Setting Up Optimizer and Scheduler:** Configuring the optimizer and learning rate scheduler for training the model.

- **Defining Performance Metrics:** Implementing functions to calculate accuracy and F1 score for evaluation.

- **Training Loop:** Running the training loop to fine-tune the BERT model on the sentiment analysis task.

- **Loading and Evaluating Model:** Loading a trained model and evaluating its performance on the validation dataset.

## Results
After running the training loop, the model's performance can be evaluated using accuracy and F1 score. The model's trained weights are saved after each epoch.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how to perform sentiment analysis using BERT, a transformer-based language model. By following the steps outlined in the notebook/script, you can adapt this code for your own sentiment analysis tasks or other text classification projects.
